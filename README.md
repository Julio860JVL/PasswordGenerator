I saw this password generator from:
https://1password.com/password-generator/
And I liked the colors black for letters, blue for numbers and red for symbols.

So I decided to create my own version that contains the colors:
Green for lower case letters.
White for upper case letters.
Blue for numbers.
And red for symbols.

I didn't put too much effor into the UI. So it needs a lot of work.
